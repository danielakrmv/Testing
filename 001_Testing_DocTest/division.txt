---------------------------
How to use "division"
---------------------------

The "division" function needs to be imported from the **my_math** module like that:
>>> from my_math import division

Now you can use "division" to division various data types together, such as integer, float and more.

Here is an example:
>>> division(9.0, 3)
    3.0

>>> division(9.0, 4.5)
2.0

We can't do division by zero
>>> division(9.0, 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    ZeroDivisionError: float division by zero

>>> division("Hi", "Daniela")
    Traceback (most recent call last):
    TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for /: 'str' and 'str'
